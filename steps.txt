Your data engineering project involves several steps, and you'll need to utilize various tools and technologies to achieve each requirement. Here's a high-level overview of how you can approach this project:

Setup AWS Services:

S3 Bucket: Create an S3 bucket where you'll store your data.
Redshift Cluster: Set up a Redshift cluster for data warehousing.
RDS Database: Create an RDS instance for your relational database.
Write Application:

Use a programming language like Python to write an application that handles the data pipeline.
Utilize libraries like boto3 for interacting with AWS services.
Implement functionality to read data from endpoints. You can use libraries like requests for making HTTP requests.
Write logic to persist the data into the S3 bucket. You can compress the data into a zip file before storing it if needed.
Ensure error handling and logging mechanisms are in place for reliability and monitoring.
Data Pipeline:

Schedule your application to run periodically (daily, in your case). You can use cron jobs, AWS Lambda, or a scheduling service like Airflow for this purpose.
Configure the scheduled job to trigger your application, which will fetch data from the endpoints and store it in the S3 bucket.
Load Data into Redshift:

Use Redshift's COPY command or AWS Glue to load data from the S3 bucket into your Redshift cluster. Ensure that the data is properly formatted and compatible with Redshift's requirements.
You can schedule this process to run after the data has been persisted in the S3 bucket.
Load Data into RDS:

Depending on the type of RDS database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), you can use tools like psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL) or pymysql (for MySQL) in your application to connect to the RDS instance and load data directly from either the S3 bucket or from Redshift (if that's more efficient).
Implement logic to transform and load the data into the RDS database tables.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Set up monitoring and alerting for your data pipeline using AWS CloudWatch or other monitoring tools.
Regularly monitor the pipeline for errors, performance issues, and data inconsistencies.
Iterate on your application and pipeline based on feedback and changing requirements.
Remember to consider security best practices, such as managing IAM roles and permissions for accessing AWS services securely, encrypting data at rest and in transit, and ensuring compliance with any regulatory requirements. Additionally, document your pipeline thoroughly for future reference and troubleshooting.
